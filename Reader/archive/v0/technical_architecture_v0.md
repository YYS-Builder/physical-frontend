## Data Flow

1. **Image Processing Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Image Service -> Processing Engine -> Storage -> Response
   ```

2. **Data Embedding Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Data Service -> Processing Engine -> Image Service -> Storage -> Response
   ```

3. **Extraction Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Image Service -> Processing Engine -> Data Service -> Response
   ```
