## Sprint Goals
- Implement advanced document analysis features
- Enhance collaboration capabilities
- Improve document sharing and permissions
- Optimize performance for large documents

## Timeline
- Start Date: 2024-03-15
- End Date: 2024-03-28
- Duration: 2 weeks

## User Stories

### Document Analysis
1. As a user, I want to analyze document sentiment to understand the tone and emotional content
   - Implement sentiment analysis API endpoint
   - Create sentiment visualization component
   - Add sentiment summary to document details

2. As a user, I want to extract key entities from documents
   - Implement entity extraction service
   - Create entity visualization component
   - Add entity summary to document details

3. As a user, I want to classify documents into categories
   - Implement document classification service
   - Add category tags to documents
   - Create category management interface

### Collaboration
4. As a user, I want to share documents with specific permissions
   - Implement granular permission system
   - Create share dialog with permission options
   - Add permission management interface

5. As a user, I want to collaborate on documents in real-time
   - Implement real-time collaboration service
   - Create collaboration status indicators
   - Add user presence indicators

### Performance
6. As a user, I want to work with large documents efficiently
   - Implement document chunking for large files
   - Optimize document loading and rendering
   - Add progress indicators for large operations
